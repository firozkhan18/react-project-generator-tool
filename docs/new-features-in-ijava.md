|------------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Java 7** (Released in July 2011) | **Try-with-resources** | Simplifies the management of resources such as streams, connections, and files by automatically closing them after use. | Ideal for managing resources like file streams and database connections. | Reduces boilerplate code, prevents resource leaks, and ensures better resource management. |
| | **Diamond Operator (`<>`)** | Allows the compiler to infer the type arguments in generics. | Used in generic classes and methods. Example: `Map<String, List<String>> map = new HashMap<>();` | Improves code readability and reduces redundancy in specifying generic types. |
| | **Strings in Switch Statements** | Enables `String` objects to be used in `switch` statements. | Common in cases where actions depend on string values (e.g., command line inputs). | Increases performance and readability when switching over string values. |

Includes features like symbolic links, file attributes, and improved Path API. | Used for file manipulation and directory management (e.g., copying files, walking directories). | Simplifies file handling and provides more flexibility compared to previous I/O APIs. |
| | **Fork/Join Framework** | Designed for parallelism, it allows efficient parallel processing of tasks. | Useful in multi-core processors where tasks can be split and executed in parallel. | Improves performance by taking advantage of multicore processors and simplifying parallel processing. |
| **Java 8** (Released in March 2014) | **Lambda Expressions** | Introduces functional programming concepts such as lambda expressions for passing behavior as parameters. | Used in collections, event handling, and parallel streams. Example: `list.forEach(e -> System.out.println(e));` | Increases conciseness, readability, and allows functional programming in Java. |
| | **Streams API** | Supports functional-style operations on sequences of elements. Allows filter, map, reduce operations in a declarative style. | Useful for working with large data sets, filtering, transforming, or aggregating collections. | Facilitates cleaner, more expressive code, and can potentially improve performance with parallel streams. |
| | **Default Methods in Interfaces** | Interfaces can now have method implementations. | Allows for backward compatibility in interfaces while adding new functionality. | Reduces the need for creating abstract classes or breaking existing code when adding new methods. |

| | **Improved Javadoc** | New features in `Javadoc`, including support for generating HTML5 output. | Used in generating API documentation. | Enhances the quality and readability of API documentation. |
| | **Compact Strings** | Optimizes string storage by using a more compact representation when only ASCII characters are used. | Automatically applied to `String` objects that only contain ASCII characters. | Reduces memory footprint for applications dealing with lots of text in ASCII. |
| **Java 10** (Released in March 2018) | **Local-Variable Type Inference** | Allows `var` keyword for local variable declarations, letting the compiler infer the type. | Used for variable declarations where the type is obvious from context. Example: `var list = new ArrayList<String>();` | Increases code readability and reduces verbosity. |
| | **Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS)** | Enhances the Class Data Sharing (CDS) feature to share application classes. | Helps in reducing startup time for applications by sharing classes across multiple Java processes. | Reduces application startup time and improves memory usage efficiency. |
| **Java 11** (Released in September 2018) | **HTTP Client API (Standard)** | The new `HttpClient` API replaces the old `HttpURLConnection` for making HTTP requests. | Used for making HTTP requests, handling responses, and working with REST APIs. | Simplifies HTTP operations and offers better support for HTTP/2, WebSockets, and asynchronous requests. |
| | **String Methods** | New methods added to the `String` class like `isBlank()`, `lines()`, `strip()`, etc. | Used for string manipulation (e.g., stripping whitespace, checking if a string is blank). | Improves string handling and makes it easier to work with strings. |
| | **Running Java Code in Containers** | Java 11 optimizes its use in containerized environments (like Docker). | Enables better resource management when running Java applications in containers. | Ensures predictable resource usage and performance inside containers. |
| | **Deprecation of `java.awt` and `java.applet`** | Marks some older APIs (e.g., `Applet`) for removal. | Encourages migration away from outdated APIs. | Reduces maintenance overhead and encourages the use of modern technologies. |
| **Java 12** (Released in March 2019) | **Switch Expressions** | Extends the `switch` statement to return a value and use multiple labels. | Used for more concise, readable, and flexible switch statements. Example: `var result = switch (day) { case MONDAY -> "Start"; default -> "End"; };` | Enhances code clarity and simplifies control flow in cases with multiple conditions. |
| | **Shenandoah GC (Garbage Collector)** | A low-latency garbage collector. | Used for applications where minimizing garbage collection pauses is critical. | Reduces pause times, improving the responsiveness of latency-sensitive applications. |
| **Java 13** (Released in September 2019) | **Text Blocks** | Introduces multi-line string literals. | Used for handling multi-line strings such as JSON or SQL queries. Example: `String query = """SELECT * FROM users""";` | Simplifies the use of multi-line strings and improves code readability. |
| **Java 14** (Released in March 2020) | **Records** | Introduces a new type of class that acts as a transparent carrier for immutable data. | Ideal for simple data-holding classes (DTOs, value objects). Example: `record Person(String name, int age) {}` | Reduces boilerplate code by auto-generating `toString()`, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and constructors. |
| | **Pattern Matching for `instanceof`** | Simplifies the `instanceof` check by combining it with type casting. | Used to simplify code where an object needs to be checked for type and cast. Example: `if (obj instanceof String s) {}` | Increases code readability and reduces boilerplate. |
